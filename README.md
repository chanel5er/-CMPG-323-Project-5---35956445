The goal of this project is to create a PowerBI report for the connected devices. Some of the main catagories will be the device registration info and device monotoring info. There will also be a dashboard that displays some of the Key Performance Indicators for the data.

Users can use the report to extract the information that they require from the connected devices database. They also have the option to filter by page or by certain visual elements.
